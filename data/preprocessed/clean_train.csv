"well the logic of claiming/consuming instances is not what caused this bug and it is well tested . what caused it is moving to and from objects in the resource tracker, and then dropping an important field due to that. so in the resource tracker we have pci pool dicts would contain numa_node as a key , butthen we convert them to objects 1 by using pcidevicepool.from_dict, which would drop the field and save it as part of tags. upon reading them in on the scheduler side, we call pcidevicepool.to_dict, which of course will not know about the 'numa_node' since it is not on the object. for filtering to work numa_node needs to match and it is actually gone so all requests fail. the code in 1 merged 2 months after the patch that introduces numa awareness of pci devices. tl; dr - this got borken by our neverending objects fuckery - it was not broken by definition as you seem to imply with your comments here. the commit message is misleading though so i will update it now. 1";"1"

"i definitely agree we should not mix the two. i think the list syntax makes more sense in this case than it does in capabilities i previously made comments to this end on that spec, butthey got lost in a previous patchset, so i'll review it again soon . take a simple resource registry: resource_registry: os::tripleo::blockstorage: cinder-storage.yaml os::tripleo::compute: compute.yaml what that is saying is that when a template creates a resource of type blockstorage, it should use the cinder-storage.yaml file. taking the example from the capabilities: requires: deployment: puppet resource_registry: os::tripleo::controller: puppet/controller.yaml, docker/controller.yaml you as the template reader/maintainer, not as heat programmatically reading it are no longer able to see what template will be used. that information has moved to the ""requires"" area plus some additional logic that looks inside the templates themselves. now factor in the alternative in this spec for using a parameter driven approach. that is now a third place you need to look to understand which template s will be used to fulfill a given type, leaving us with the following to understand a set of templates: 1. look in the resource registry to see the mapping for a type. 2. if the mapping is a list, look at the requires and the contents of each template referenced to see which one will fulfill the requires. 3. look through the top level template itself for any resourcechain resources, determine the name of the parameter that is used to convey the list of templates in the chain, then resolve what the current value of that parameter is. imo, this is a rough experience for the user. we've taken the knowledge of how a stack will be created and spread it over the course of multiple areas and files. by comparison, my argument is that: - capabilities are not a black box resolution by heat, but rather just metadata the user can ask heat to introspect to determine valid mappings to make in the resource_registry. - chains are communicated inside of the registry itself. that flow leaves the mappings in a single place: the resource registry. it is simpler both for user comprehension and clients that may be layering on top of the templates.";"0"

"it took me a month to understand what this code wassupposed to do, so who is being stupid here : . first, i find out if the destination is 1 cell or a range, and if the source area is large than the selected destination area 1271-1279 . the largest area of these is taken for the comparisons 1282-1283 , as this will be the actual destination area copy/paste some blocks and you will see what i mean if my text is not clear . the first comparison is whether source and destination area overlap 1284-1288 . when the source area contains references, these probably will go wrong when there is an overlap. as this may produce data loss e.g. formulas that get wrong references , it _must_ be avoided. this code was there from the beginning, but with errors, disabling the wrong options. my first patch fixed only a part of that. the second comparison 1294-1327 handles something else, the question whether shifting the cells in the destination area will fit on the sheet. this comparison is not necessary for integrity, but for user friendliness. without the comparison, the user will get a message that the result will not fit and no harm is done. rainer bielefeld wanted the possibilty of fitting on the sheet reflected in the en/disabling of the shift options. i do this check by going from the maxcol/maxrow position back for the width/height of the destination area and checking if the cells are empty. if not, paste+shift will not fit and the appropiate shitoption is disabled. i feared a performance penalty with this method, butitested it on an old. slow machine complete build of libreofiice takes 24hrs with a destination area almost maxrow high and that gave no noticeable delay. but because of this performance penalty danger, i want you to have a good look at the code. perhaps it will be safer to leave it out, perhaps there are more efficient ways to check the fitting. i hope my proze give you the explanation you want. perhaps i should put some of it in the code as comment";"1"
